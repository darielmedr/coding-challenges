# Are anagrams?

Two strings form an anagram, if and only if they contain the same number of characters, the order of the characters does not matter. If two strings are anagrams, one string can be rearranged to form the other string. For example:

- `abc` and `cba`.
- `listen` and `silent`.
- `snooze alarms` and `alas, no more Z's`
